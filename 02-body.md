### 4.1 Data Governance Council Composition and Roles

The Data Governance Council consists of representatives from key departments to ensure diverse perspectives. Members are appointed by the executive leadership and serve for a term of two years, with the possibility of renewal. Brief descriptions of the roles are as follows:

- **Executive Sponsor**: A senior leader (e.g., CEO or Deputy Director) who provides strategic oversight, champions data governance initiatives, and aligns them with organizational goals.
- **Data Governance Lead**: Coordinates council activities, facilitates meetings, and acts as the primary point of contact for data governance issues; responsible for tracking progress on data-related projects.
- **Data Owners**: Department heads (e.g., from Programs, Finance, and Development) who are accountable for the quality and usage of data within their domains, including defining access controls and ensuring data accuracy.
- **Data Stewards**: Operational staff from various teams who manage day-to-day data activities, such as data entry, cleansing, and reporting; they identify and resolve data quality issues.
- **IT Representative**: A technical expert who advises on data infrastructure, security tools, and integration needs to support governance efforts.
- **Legal/Privacy Advisor**: Ensures data practices align with privacy laws and ethical standards, providing guidance on data sharing and consent.

## 5. Meetings

The Data Governance Council meets quarterly to review data governance activities, address emerging issues, and make decisions on policies and standards. Additional ad-hoc meetings may be scheduled as needed, such as in response to significant data incidents or project milestones. Agendas are distributed at least one week in advance, and minutes are recorded and shared with all members and relevant stakeholders.

## 6. Data Standards and Definitions

The council establishes and maintains a data dictionary that defines key terms, metrics, and standards to ensure consistency across the organization. This includes guidelines for data classification, metadata management, and quality assurance processes.

## 7. Conflict Resolution for Definitional Issues

Definitional conflicts, such as disagreements on data terms, classifications, or standards, are resolved through a structured process:

- **Initial Discussion**: Conflicts are first addressed during council meetings via open dialogue to seek consensus.
- **Voting Mechanism**: If consensus cannot be reached, a majority vote among council members is conducted, with the Executive Sponsor holding a tie-breaking vote if necessary.
- **Escalation**: Unresolved issues are escalated to the organization's executive leadership team for final arbitration, ensuring alignment with strategic priorities. All resolutions are documented in the data dictionary for future reference.
